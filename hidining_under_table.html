<p>You slide under the kitchen table and roll into the smallest ball you can. No way in cold hell is this going to work, you think. Surprisingly, you see, from under the table, the killer bounds right past the kitchen, seemingly convinced that you’re hiding in the basement. With a heavy limp from where you stabbed his thigh, he gets to the basement door, throws it open, and heads down. You hear a muffled crash. You should probably take this opportunity to get back upstairs.
