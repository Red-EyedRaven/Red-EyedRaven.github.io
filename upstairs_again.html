<p>Trying to strike a delicate balance between staying silent and moving at Sonic speed, you climb back upstairs. At the top of the stairs, you spot a blood-covered knife. YOUR bloody knife, dropped by the killer after it was stabbed into his thigh. You pick it back up.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE OBTAINED KNIFE. AGAIN.</p>
<p> You move in a blur, fueled by adrenaline. The door to your bedroom is locked, but you remember where the key is and retrieve it from the supply closet down the hall.</p> 
<p>YOU HAVE OBTAINED KEY.</p>
<p> You’re at your bedroom door. The key is in your hands. Insert, twist, push, and you’re in! The teleprinter is in the corner of your room. You boot it up and contact the police immediately. Let’s hope they’re quicker than they appear to be in the movies. But there's a more pressing issue right now. At any moment, a murderous psychopath is going to be climbing up the stairs and personally introducing you to the pointy end of his knife. How do you deal with the situation?
