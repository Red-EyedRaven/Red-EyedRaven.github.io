<p> You swing open the door to the basement, close it behind you, and roll down the stairs in your haste. It’s dark and you need to hide somewhere. There’s a mini bar in your basement, complete with counter and everything. That is  where you hide. The killer soon tumbled down the stairs, hungry for blood. You’re hiding pretty swell and he doesn’t seem to find you. He comes close though. He turns around and makes to go up the stairs again. You subconsciously relax a little, relief flooding through your body like the sweetest honey. As he disappears above, you move from your hiding place, but in doing so, you accidentally knock over a wine bottle on the bar countertop! It falls to the floor and shatters! Though the breaking happens in silence for you, the intruder surely hears it. You stare in horror at the wine stained basement carpet, as the killer comes crashing down the stairs and gets to his job: murder. Your blood soon joins the wine in staining the carpet.
