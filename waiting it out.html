<p> Using your key, you lock the door to your room. Just to be safe, you form a mini barricade at the door by pushing your dresser and desk up against it. Breathless, you sit down on your bed. The police have been called and the door is barred. Now all you have to do is wait. Before long, you see the door starts shaking, tremors seizing it as the killer on the other side pounds on it, again and again! For a single, terrifying moment, you fear that the door would break down and the barricade would be breached. But the wooden aegis held, and the shaking died down. It soon stopped completely. The police arrived in about 7 minutes. Blaring red and blue lights shot through your window, sending relief flooding through your body. You unbar the door and go out to meet the cops. The killer is nowhere to be seen. You are safe now.
