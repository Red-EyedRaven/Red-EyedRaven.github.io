<p> Officer Harris and Officer Louis were the first to enter the door. Immediately, they saw a woman, sitting on the couch, armed with a bloody knife still in her hands. “Intruder spotted!” Louis yelled. “You! Drop the weapon!” Harris shouted. The woman didn’t comply with the request, acted like she didn’t hear it. She stood up from the couch and approached the officers. BANG! BANG! Two shots rang out; one missed the woman, and one hit her in the chest. She collapsed, shocked, and in pain. Other officers flooded into the house, and asked for a report on the situation. Harris gave them one, while Louis went to look upstairs. He called back downstairs, telling the others that he had found the homeowner, stabbed in the back and dead in the bedroom. The intruder was taken to the hospital, but expired on the way. What a grim night, the officers agreed.
